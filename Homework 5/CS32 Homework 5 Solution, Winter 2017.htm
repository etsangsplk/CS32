O(C + S).  We'd have to do a linear search through the outer vector to
find the course, which is O(C), and then after that do a linear search of
the S students in the list, which is O(S).  We can't do a binary search in a
linked list in logarithmic time, because it takes linear time just to get to
the middle item of a list, sorted or not.
</li>
<li>
O((log C) + S).  A BST-based map finds the course in O(log C) time,
and after that we do a linear search of the S students in the list.
</li>
<li>
O(log C + log S).  A BST-based map finds the course in O(log C) time,
and a BST-based set finds the student in O(log S) time.  Notice that
a mathematically equivalent way to write this is O(log CS), but that
form makes it harder to understand why it's right.
</li>
<li>
O(log S).  A hash-based map finds the course in O(1) time, and a BST-based
set finds the student in O(log S) time.  Notice that a constant like 1 is
dominated by a function that grows with S, so we write O(log S) instead of
O(1 + log S).
</li>
<li>
O(1).  A hash-based map finds the course in O(1) time, and a hash-based
set finds the student in O(1) time.
</li>
<li>
O((log C) + S).  A BST-based map finds the course in O(log C) time, and we
can visit all S items in order in a BST-based set in O(S) time.
</li>
<li>
O(S log S).  A hash-based map finds the course in O(1) time, and although we
can visit all S items in a hash-based set in O(S) time, they'd be in whatever
order the hash function caused them to be scattered across the buckets. 
We have to sort them.  It takes O(S) steps to get them into and out of an
auxiliary vector, say, and O(S log S) to sort them.
</li>
<li>
O(C log S).  The hash-based map is keyed on the course, not the student, so
it's not organized to look up students efficiently.  Our only choice is to
check every course and see in O(log S) time whether the student is in its
set of students.  Since we have to do the O(log S) operation for each of the
C courses, it's O(C log S).
